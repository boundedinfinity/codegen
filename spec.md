# Specification

## General

### ID

A **kind** **ID** has the following format:

```
canonical://path/to/schema
```

Where the _scheme_ portion of the URL is `canonical`.

## Kind

-   `kind`:

    The **kind** field describes the type this definition.

    This field can contain one of the built-in **kind**s:

    -   `string`
    -   `integer`
    -   `float`
    -   `array`
    -   `object`
    -   `enum`
    -   `ref`
    -   `one2one`
    -   `one2many`
    -   `many2many`
    -   `union`

    If the type's value is the `id` field of another type, this turns this type into a referenced type.

    If this is a referenced type, then referenced type's fields will be inserted into this type. If this type defines
    any fields, the fields in this type will overried the fields from the given `id` referenced type.

-   `id`:
    The **id** field is a URL which describes the globally unique identifier for this description.

    The **sheme** should be **canonical** e.g.:

    ```
    canonical://path/to/schema
    ```

-   `id`:

    The identifier of this type.

    This is an optional field.

    If this field is present it indicates that this is a custom type. Code generation tooling should create a custom
    class, struct, or relavent type for the language.

    The last portion of the `id` field will be used in a language appropriate way for the targetied language, if no
    other name overrides the name by defining the `name` property.

-   `name`:

    The name of this type.

    If this field is defined if may do one of the following:

    -   If defined on a type with a defined `id` field, this type will become the name of the custom type.
    -   Otherwise this will become a field name inside the `properties` field of an `object` type.

    If this field isn't defined a name is created using the method described
    in the `id` section.

-   `description`:

    A common field for all types.

    If defined this fields should be a detailed description of this type.

    Descriptions can be formated using any of the following formats:

    -   `text`
    -   `markdown`
    -   `HTML`
    -   `asciidoc`

    Descriptions are merged with override types, where the description of the overriding type is place at thie top with
    then a new line (or format appropriate newline), then the overriden's description in added below.

-   `min`:

    Optional minimum of this type.

    If defined on an `integer` or `float` type this will be the inclusve minimum value which that type will contain.

    If defined on a `string` type, this will be the minimum length of the string.

    This will be an error on any other type.

-   `max`:

    Optional maximum of this type.

    If defined on an `integer` or `float` type this will be the inclusve maximum value which that type will contain.

    If defined on a `string` type, this will be the maximum length of the string.

    This will be an error on any other type.

-   `regex`:

    Optional regular expression pattern.

    The given `string` value must conform to the pattern defined in the `regex` field.

    This will be an error on any other type.

-   `abnf`:

    Optional ABNF pattern.

    The given `string` value must conform to the pattern defined in the `abnf` field.

    This will be an error on any other type.

-   `unique`:

    This is only applicable for `array` types with `items` of `string`, `integer` and `float` types or references to
    types of the same.

-   `queryable`:

    Boolean value which marks this field as queryable.

    This is only applicable for `properties` in `object` types.

-   `sql`:

    The is a section that configure various aspects of the SQL mapping.

    This is only applicable for `object` types.

    -   `sql.name`:

        The name of this field.

        If not provided the `name` field is translated to a database appropriate name.

    -   `sql.table`

        Override the table name of the generated table.

### Operations

-   `id`:

    The identifier of this operation.

    This is a required field.

    The last portion of the `id` field will be used in a language appropriate way for the targetied language, if no
    other name overrides the name by defining the `name` property.

-   `name`:

    The name of this operation.

    If this field isn't defined a name is created using the method described
    in the `id` section.

-   `inputs`:

    List of input types for this operation.

    These follow the same rules defined in the **Kind**s section.

-   `outputs`:

    List of output types for this operation.

    These follow the same rules defined in the **Kind**s section.

### Data

-   `type`:

    The URL of the an `id` from the **Kind**s section.

-   `items`:

    List of items that must conform to the shape of the type referenced
    by the `id` pointed to in the `type` field.
